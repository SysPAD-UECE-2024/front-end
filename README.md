# Project Description

This project aims to study techniques and methodologies to propose a system for data protection based on cloud computing, to enable a higher capacity processing without encumbering the computational resources of devices and local servers of companies and government institutions. Thus, the objective is to develop a system for receiving data through a communication API, anonymization configuration considered adequate, protecting data through encryption and returning anonymized data to system users. Finally, the prototype was deployed in a cloud environment to carry out a robust experimental analysis.

The Web application is being built to be a easy way for the final user to use the data protection provided by this project.
